# DEC-10 Simula manuals

This directory contains the documentation for the DECsystem-10 Simula compiler.

This compiler was one of the most popular Simula compilers. The
documentation contains a lot of information, for instance the parts
covering the DEC-10 Simula debugger, that is irrelevant unless you are
programming Simula on a DEC-10. Most probably you're not.

But still, these manuals are probably the one of the best available
sources for information on the Simula language.

If you plan to do any Simula programming using the CIM compiler
present in this Docker image you should be aware that (a) the CIM
compiler does not support the full Simula specification and (b) the
DEC-10 Simula compiler contained some nonstandard (and mostly DEC-10
hardware-specific) enhancements to the language.

Happy hacking.
